# DADA2_pipeline_ampliconASVs

This pipeline is adapted from Callahan et al 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3869 ; https://github.com/benjjneb/dada2) to process 16S rRNA reads.
This pipeline will processes raw pair-end reads --> run through quality control --> filtering and trimming --> sorting by ASVs --> merge pair-end reads --> remove chimeras -->  assign microbial taxonomy (silva v138) --> explore diversity and relative abundance
