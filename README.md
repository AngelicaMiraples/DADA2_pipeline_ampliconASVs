# DADA2_pipeline_ampliconASVs

This pipeline is adapted from Dr. Benjamin Callahan to process 16S rRNA reads
This pipeline will processes raw pair-end reads --> run through quality control --> filtering and trimming --> sorting by ASVs --> merge pair-end reads --> remove chimeras -->  assign microbial taxonomy (silva v138) --> explore diversity and relative abundance
